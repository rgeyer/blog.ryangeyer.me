[{"categories":["Ender 3","Projects"],"contents":"Coming off of my plans to upgrade and tune my Ender 3, I started to work on printing the new hot-end mount and cooling system in the form of the excellent Hero Me Gen5.\nHero Me Gen 5 As I also mentioned in that post, I decided to bring my customizations and build up-to-date with a new direct drive mount from PrinterMods, namely the MDD v1.3.\nWith that in mind, I scoured the very thorough documentation, and watched the assembly video from TeachingTech, at which point I put together the list of parts I needed to print for my combination of components.\nHMG5 Parts List;\n PM_v1.3_CR-Ender-E3D-Gantry_Adapter_5B.stl PM_Gantry_Clip_5.stl Hero_Me_Gen5_Base_3.stl HMG5_E3D_V6-Clone_Collar.stl HMG5_E3D_V6-Clone_Air_Dam.stl 5015_Lightweight_Duct_Standard_Right.stl 5015_Lightweight_Duct_Standard_Left.stl EZABL_Mount_Medium_18mm.stl DD Adapters? Pg. 9 of assembly guide  Notice the last bullet? Well, I\u0026rsquo;m using the OEM Extruder, so the only apparent match was the PM_OEM_Extruder_adapter.stl. I would discover later, when attempting to assemble my new parts, that this is NOT compatible with the MDD v1.3, which apparently moved the DD extruder mounting points a couple mm closer to the hotend.\nAfter some quick searching, it didn\u0026rsquo;t appear as though anyone else had solved this problem, tho a handful of comments did appear on the original thingiverse posting for the HMG5. Rather than wait for a solution from the original designer, or the community, I went ahead and designed my own mount which you can find as a remix on thingiverse.\n     Previous   Next   X Gantry While assembling all of this, it became clear to me that the left and right sides of the X gantry were not level! This almost certainly would have contributed to the bed leveling and first layer adhesion problems I was having!\nI measured from the X gantry to the top of the frame, and discovered that the right side (the PSU side, furthest from the Z axis screw) was nearly 1cm HIGHER than the left side. I have no idea how this would have happened, and my expectation is that if anything the right side would \u0026ldquo;sag\u0026rdquo; since it isn\u0026rsquo;t directly supported by a Z screw.\nA quick run through the steps in this excellent video got things squared back up and close enough to equal that I can\u0026rsquo;t detect a difference with the naked eye.\nPEI Spring Sheet \u0026amp; solid bed mounts The final step was to replace the bed leveling springs with solid mounts, and install a new magnetic sheet for a PEI spring sheet.\nI removed my glass sheet, and the original magnet on the heated bed. This made way to install the new magnetic sheet, and stick the PEI spring sheet on top of that.\nI will still be printing with either the glass, or this new spring sheet, depending on the models and materials I print. I intend to setup different slicer profiles with different z offsets to accommodate for this. More on that in a future post.\n    Previous   Next   Next steps That covers all of the mechanical upgrades that I had planned. You may notice in the pictures that the wires are a bit of a disaster. This is intentional, since I\u0026rsquo;m going to tidy those up, and get the wiring for the inductive ABL sensor dialed in as another installment of this series of blog posts. So, keep your eyes peeled here!\n","permalink":"https://blog.ryangeyer.me/blog/ender3-hero-me-gen5-upgrade/","tags":null,"title":"Ender 3 Upgrades Pt. 2 (Hero Me Gen5 \u0026 PEI Spring Sheet)"},{"categories":["Ender 3","Projects"],"contents":"Humble beginnings If I\u0026rsquo;m honest, it\u0026rsquo;s been so long since I printed with my Ender 3 that I don\u0026rsquo;t really remember what sort of issues or failures it was suffering from.\nI think that I was having some bed adhesion issues, and I\u0026rsquo;ve always had lackluster cooling on this machine. So after it has been sitting idle for over 6mo while my Prusa MK3s has been busy being a workhorse, it\u0026rsquo;s time to work out the bugs and get the Ender 3 printing again.\nWhen I first got it on the bench, I had a clear idea of what I wanted to accomplish. I wanted to replace my bed leveling springs with solid mounts, add a magnetic removable PEI sheet bed, and swap out my BLTouch for an 18mm inductive (PINDA style) probe for auto bed leveling (ABL).\nI had begun to suspect the BLTouch\u0026rsquo;s accuracy ever since I had a particularly messy failed print, that actually bent the probe! I did manage to clean it up, and bend it back, and things seemed to be working just fine. I was just never as confident that it was doing it\u0026rsquo;s job.\nFeature creep In order to mount the new probe, I needed to print a new mount for it. \u0026ldquo;No big deal!\u0026rdquo; I said to myself. Except, that\u0026rsquo;s never how it turns out.\nYou see, my Ender 3 already has a few modifications on it. Namely, I have a genuine E3D V6 HotEnd, and an early Basaraba direct drive gantry plate. I hold the whole thing together with some 3D printed mounts from the designer of the Hero Me modular hot end cooling system. This particular combination has worked very well for me, but as I was about to find out, it\u0026rsquo;s become completely outdated by new designs and options.\nIf I wanted to switch to the new probe, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t fit \u0026ldquo;under\u0026rdquo; the direct drive extruder anymore since it\u0026rsquo;s quite a tall sensor. All of the available options for 3D printable mounts and cooling options no longer supported my directdrive gantry plate anymore either!\nSo I decided I\u0026rsquo;d go ahead with printing the full Hero Me Gen5, with dual 5015 cooling fans. This meant also upgrading my gantry plate to something which would be compatible. In looking over all my parts to make sure I had a complete BOM, I realized that this entire time I\u0026rsquo;ve ALSO been running a 12v 5015 part cooling fan on my 24v powersupply, and that the Hero Me Gen5 requires a 4020 fan for the hotend rather than the 30mm fan that the E3D V6 already uses!\nFinal task list With all of that sorted, here\u0026rsquo;s everything that will be included in this project.\nIn this post I\u0026rsquo;ll be upgrading the following;\n Install a PEI magnetic removable print surface Hero Me Gen5 HotEnd cooling system w/ dual 5015 parts cooling fans. 18mm Industrial Inductive ABL sensor PrinterMods (Basaraba\u0026rsquo;s new \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; store) Modular DirectDrive (MDD) v1.3 gantry plate PrinterMods Aluminum Extruder parts Update Marlin firmware (Re)Calibrate  HotEnd PID Linear acceleration E steps    The work begins After encountering all of the feature creep, I ordered parts, and started printing the Hero Me Gen5 parts, which means I have a few days to wait until I can dive in and really get my hands dirty. Stay tuned here for updates and I\u0026rsquo;ll break down each of these tasks.\n","permalink":"https://blog.ryangeyer.me/blog/ender3-upgrade-pt1/","tags":null,"title":"Ender 3 Upgrades Pt. 1"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://blog.ryangeyer.me/","tags":null,"title":"Ryan Geyer"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Open Source Theme from Okkur for your next project.\nSyna is based on the awesome work by digitalcraftsman with his Hugo Agency Theme.\nThe Hugo Agency Theme was based on the work of David Miller with his Startupbootstrap Agency Theme.\nProvided with \u0026lt;3 by Okkur Labs\n To actually test out the full single page some Lorem Ipsum:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
